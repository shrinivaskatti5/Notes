There are many version version control tools available:
1. git
2. svn
3. cvs
4. TFS

Git (Global information tracker)-source code management tool
Is is version control syatem or tool which is used to track versions files and directories.

Difference between Git and SVN
Git - Git is a distributed version control system means whole repository will be there in the local workspace.
If you want to switch to previous version of code you can do it in the local workspace itself.
Git has many features like rebase, fetch and stash etc.

svn - It is a centralized version control system where we have only latest version of a code in the local workspace.
If you want to switch to a previous versions of code then you need to checkout that prevoius version from central.
It doesn't have direct commands.

Git installation 

On ubuntu 
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install -y git

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
$sudo yum -y update
$sudo yum install -y git

* Git commands

1. To configure name and email globally for all users on a soecific machine
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "emai id"

2. create git repository directory
mkdir <gitreponame>

3. Initialize git repository
cd git_repo/
git init

4. ls -al - to make sure .git is present

5. vi <filename> : Add few lines and save it

6. git status : To check whether the files are in workspace or staging area or in local/remote repo.
                To make sure working directory is clean.

7. git add <filename> : To add files from workspace to staging area.
           syn : git add <filename>
                 git add .
                 git add -u
                 git add -add
8. git commit -m "<msg>" : This will commit the files from staging area to git repo.

9. git log : It shows the history of the repository. 

10. git log <filename> : It shows the history of single file

11. git log -2 : It shows the latest 2 commits of any file.

12. git log -2 <filename> :	It shows the latest 2 commits of particular file.

Workflow of Git

* Worspace : It is a directory where we modify project related files.
             Files present in the workspace are untracked files.
             To move the files from workspace to staging area we use git add command.
* Staging area/Index area : Here we save the changes.
                 To save the changes we use "git commit" it will get committed to the git repo.
                 Here commit id will get created and the files present in this area are called as indexed file.	
* Local repo/git repo : It is a location where version controlling happens and the files present here are called as committed files.
